I work on problems at the interface of statistical and population genetics. I am also interested in the ethical and social implications of human genetics research; I recently developed and taught a class on [Genetics, Ethics, and Society](https://roshnipatel.github.io/teaching/2022-genetics-ethics-society).

I received my PhD in Genetics from Stanford, where I was advised by [Jonathan Pritchard](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html).
