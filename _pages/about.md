I am currently a postdoc with [Doc Edge](https://edgepopgen.github.io/edgelab/) at the University of Southern California. I received my PhD in Genetics from Stanford, where I was advised by [Jonathan Pritchard](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html).

I work on problems at the interface of statistical and population genetics. I am also interested in the ethical and social implications of human genetics research; I recently developed and taught a class on [Genetics, Ethics, and Society](https://stanford-genethics.github.io/).
