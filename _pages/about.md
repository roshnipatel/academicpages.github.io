Hello!

I'm a 4th year PhD Candidate in the [Stanford Genetics department](https://med.stanford.edu/genetics.html), where I am advised by [Jonathan Pritchard](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html). I work on problems in statistical genetics and am currently focused on thinking about questions in the gene expression & gene regulation space. I also help lead several service organizations that aim to increase equity and access to STEM.
