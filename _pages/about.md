Hello!

I'm a 5th year PhD Candidate in the [Stanford Genetics department](https://med.stanford.edu/genetics.html), where I am advised by [Jonathan Pritchard](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html). I work on problems at the interface of statistical and population genetics and teach a course on [Genetics, Ethics, and Society](https://roshnipatel.github.io/teaching/2022-genetics-ethics-society). I also help lead several [service](https://biojamcamp.weebly.com/) [organizations](https://med.stanford.edu/genetics/life/dei.html) that aim to increase equity and access to STEM.
