Service and leadership
======
* Co-vice president of [BioJam](https://biojamcamp.weebly.com/), 2021-2023
  * I co-design and oversee a year-long academic program that engages teens from marginalized communities in the Bay Area to explore biodesign and bioengineering through their own culture and creativity. 
* Co-lead of [The Genetics Advocacy Committee](https://med.stanford.edu/genetics/life/dei.html), 2020-2022
  * I manage six different trainee-led initiatives to increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice in the Stanford Genetics department, ranging from diversifying graduate admissions to increasing ethics education for graduate students. I also work with faculty and staff to secure department support and funding for these initiatives.
* Co-founder of Stanford Science Justice Reading Group, 2019-2020
  * I organized a monthly forum for graduate students and postdocs to think critically about science and scientific institutions, with the ultimate goal of understanding how to improve diversity and inclusion in academia.
