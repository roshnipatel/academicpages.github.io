Like many others, we've long suspected that even the largest genetic studies are underpowered to detect individual gene-by-gene or gene-by-environment interactions that influence complex traits. We develop a novel statistical method that leverages recently admixed genomes to test for genetic interactions. We apply our method to two traits: gene expression in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) within TOPMed; and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the Million Veteran Program (MVP). We find compelling evidence that genetic interactions modify the effect sizes of causal variants for complex traits.
