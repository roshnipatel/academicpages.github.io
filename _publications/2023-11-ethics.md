As trainees, we argue that an essential part of our scientific education involves thinking about the intersection of science and society: what are the broader social implications of our work, and how do societal norms and structures impact scientific research? In response to this gap we observed, we created a course that prioritizes student-led discussions and self-reflection, ultimately giving students the tools to reason through some of these big questions. We share data-driven strategies and suggestions, and make our full curriculum available on our website: [stanford-genethics.github.io](https://stanford-genethics.github.io/). This course is a community-driven solution to an institutional problem, and we hope that it can serve as a model for other institutions and/or scientific disciplines.
