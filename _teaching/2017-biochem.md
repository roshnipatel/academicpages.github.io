I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for MCB C100A: Biophysical Chemistry. I held office hours and led weekly tutoring sessions attended by ~50 students.

Course description
======
Thermodynamic and kinetic concepts applied to understanding the chemistry and structure of biomolecules (proteins, DNA, and RNA). Molecular distributions, reaction kinetics, enzyme kinetics. Bioenergetics, energy transduction, and motor proteins. Electrochemical potential, membranes, and ion channels.
