I co-led a team of graduate students and postdocs in developing curriculum for a graduate-level course on [Genetics, Ethics, and Society](https://stanford-genethics.github.io/). I was a primary course instructor in both Spring 2022 and Spring 2023. We were generously funded by a $25,000 grant from the [Ethics, Society, and Technology Hub](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/ethics-society-technology-hub) at Stanford.

Course description
======
Focus is on examining the past, present, and future relationship between human genetics and society to evaluate the ethical implications of the research we conduct. Students will reflect on their personal roles and biases in order to develop the tools needed to conduct equitable, just, and inclusive research. Topics include the intersection between science and society; history of American eugenics; community-engaged research; race, ancestry, and identity; forensic genetics; behavioral genetics; and reproductive genetics.
