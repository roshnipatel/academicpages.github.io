I am co-leading a team of graduate students and postdocs in designing a course on Genetics, Ethics, and Society for researchers in genetics and related fields. I am currently developing curriculum for the course and will be a primary course instructor when the three-week pilot course is offered in Spring 2022. We are generously funded by a $25,000 grant from the [Ethics, Society, and Technology Hub](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/ethics-society-technology-hub) at Stanford.

Course description
======
Focus is on examining the past, present, and future relationship between human genetics and society to evaluate the ethical implications of the research we conduct. Students will reflect on their personal roles and biases in order to develop the tools needed to conduct equitable, just, and inclusive research. Topics include: 1) the intersection of science and society, 2) timeline of American eugenics, 3) genome editing and the uncertain future, 4) race, ancestry, identity, and genetics, 5) justice and genetics, and 6) inclusive scientist-community relationships.
